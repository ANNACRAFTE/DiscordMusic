# Why.

Because this is an effort to make the original v5 branch commit history clean. By testing random Shit here and git commiting it to the main v5 branch once all the testing & messy commit is done.


also you should read this :)

> github throws away all the relevant information, like having even a
valid email address for the person asking me to pull. The diffstat is
also deficient and useless.
> 
> Git comes with a nice pull-request generation module, but github
instead decided to replace it with their own totally inferior version.
As a result, I consider github useless for these kinds of things. It's
fine for hosting, but the pull requests and the online commit
editing, are just pure garbage.
