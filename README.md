# Why.

Because this is an effort to make the original v5 branch commit history clean. By testing random Shit here and git commiting it to the main v5 branch once all the testing & messy commit is done.

valid email address for the person asking me to pull. The diffstat is
also deficient and useless.

As a result, I consider github useless for these kinds of things. It's
fine for hosting, but the pull requests and the online commit
editing, are just pure garbage.
